> Learning programming is a complex and lengthy process.
Perhaps the study of the syntax of the language is the simplest and shortest part on the way, but without it it is impossible to start.

> I use the resource [code-basics.com](https://ru.code-basics.com/ "code-basics.com") to study the basic syntactic features of the language or the basic features of the technology.

> And also on the resource [www.codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/ "www.codewars.com") I hone my skills in more combat missions. The most interesting code I post in my git hub.
